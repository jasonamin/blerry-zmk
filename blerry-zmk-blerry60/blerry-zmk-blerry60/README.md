# BLErry ZMK Configuration

This repository is for RMI-KB keyboards that use ZMK, specifically the BLErry series of boards. Any questions, feel free to ask in the relevant **BLErry** channel in the [RMI-KB discord server](https://discord.gg/hXcpWvg5zB).

## Known Issues

- When you do the tweezer test and you short two pins that are not part of your layout, the top left key will actuate.

    - For example with the default layout (unified backspace), if you test the right half of the split backspace, it will send Esc. This is probably a bug with ZMK.

- If you choose the HHKB bottom row layout, and then tweezer test Right Ctrl, this will make the keyboard unresponsive. Just unplug and plug again.

3. Click on the latest workflow run.

- If you did your keymap correctly, there should be a green checkmark to the left.
- Click on the relevant firmware file to download. Unzip it somewhere too.

4. Plug the USB connector in, and double press the reset button twice quickly (Has to be <500 ms apart).

- Drag and drop the UF2 file you unzipped to the mass storage device that appeared.
- I think it's named NRF52BOOT or something? Whatever the name, there should be a UF2 file inside. Don't delete or anything, just drag and drop the new `blerry60` firmware file to the mass storage device.
